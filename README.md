# NxR-Baxter Voice Recognition
## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to provide an additional dimension of human-robot interaction to the Baxter (nicknamed RJ) robot (from Rethink Robotics) currently on display in the Technological Institute at Northwestern University. Previous projects have used a motion tracker to control the robot; this project used CMU's pocketsphinx speech recognition software as an additional means to communicate with the robot. The end result of this was a "memory"-style game that challenged the user to memorize and match various sequences of poses and words provided directly by the robot. This format created an interestingly difficult competition between robot and human; ultimately, this aspect is what accomplished the goal of new forms of interaction and emotion as facilitated by voice recognition.
### Lessons Learned
The main difficulties of this project were found in the game design itself and meeting the constraints caused by the speech recognition, motion tracking, and the robot. Both the speech recognition and motion tracking peripherals run at fast enough rates to encourage real-time interaction between the robot and user, but RJ moves at a relatively slow pace, ruling out quick, reflexive movements. For an interactive game, this speed constraint poses somewhat of a problem. Additionally, both the motion tracking and voice recognition needed to be implemented in a way that showcases their capabilities and without making either feel like a trivial add-on. The iniital thought was to create a rock-paper-scissors game, where the user and the robot play against each other and the robot provides both feedback and the game interface. However, rock-paper-scissors is not much fun to play unless the game can be played quickly, and this makes it non-ideal for RJ. Additionally, the game could be completed entirely with voice recognition or motion tracking, which meant that one would likely end up being trivialized. Add on top of this the fact that RJ cannot create the standard rock-paper-scissors symbols, and it is clear why this initial idea was dismissed.  
  
The memory game, however, succeeds where rock-paper-scissors did not due to a different effect of adding both peripherals. This game could certainly (and was, in fact) completed solely with voice recognition or solely with motion tracking, but the blend of the two adds a new level of difficulty instead of overlapping to accomplish the same task. The game also inherently requires relatively long periods of motion inactivity for the robot, which is desirable, but it is during these periods that the user is performing all of their actions and the other peripherals are providing real-time feedback. This means that the game meets all performance constraints without feeling like any aspects are too limited.
