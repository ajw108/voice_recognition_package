voice_recognition_package
=========================
Project Overview
----------------
The goal of this project was to provide an additional dimension of human-robot interaction to the Baxter robot (Rethink Robotics) currently on display in the Technological Institute at Northwestern University. Previous projects have used a motion tracker to control the robot; this project used CMU's pocketsphinx speech recognition software as an additional means to communicate with the robot. The end result of this was a "memory"-style game that challenged the user to memorize and match various sequences of poses and words provided directly by the robot. This format created an interestingly difficult competition between robot and human; ultimately, this aspect is what accomplished the goal of new forms of interaction and emotion as facilitated by voice recognition.
